1. This shell script calls the ```R``` programs ```COVID_CJE_Cards``` and ```COVID_CJE_HELOCs``` in the ```Code``` folder, 
which creates the tables and figures for the manuscript,
by analyzing the datasets read in from ```Data```. 
1. When the program is finished, you will find the output For Tables 1-3 in the ```Tables``` folder and the figures will be in the ```Figures``` folder. 


## Data Availability

The primary data source is the TransUnion credit bureau. Data are provided to the Bank of Canada on a monthly basis. Under the contractual agreement with TransUnion, the data are not publicly available. The Bank of Canada does, however, have a process for external researchers to work with these data. The Bank of Canada's Financial System Research Center is a hub for research on household finance (https://www.bankofcanada.ca/research/financial-system-research-centre/). Interested parties, who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents, can contact Jason Allen (Jallen@bankofcanada.ca) or the Managing Director of research Jim MacGee (JMacGee@bankofcanada.ca). Interested parties are asked to submit a project proposal; the proposal is evaluated by senior staff at the Bank of Canada for feasibility; external researchers do not typically have direct access to the data and must work with a Bank of Canada staff. An exception is if an external collaborator applies and is granted temporary employee status -- in this case the external researcher can access the data so long as they have a Bank of Canada affiliation. All research is vetted by Bank of Canada senior staff prior to publication.
